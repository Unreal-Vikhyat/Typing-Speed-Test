                Typing is a very useful skill in today’s digital world. Many people use computers every day for study, work, and communication. When you type faster and more accurately, you can finish your tasks in less time. Typing speed improves with regular practice and patience. You do not need to rush while typing. Focus on accuracy first, then speed will increase naturally. Keep your posture correct and place your fingers properly on the keyboard. Avoid looking at the keyboard again and again. With daily practice, typing can become easy, fun, and stress free for everyone.
